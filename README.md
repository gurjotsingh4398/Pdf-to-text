# Pdf-to-text
*By Gurjot Singh*

The aim of this application is to extract text from a pdf file. This application is implemented using React on FrontEnd and NodeJS on BackEnd with the help of express-fileupload npm package.

In this app we first upload the file using React frontend, which is then sent to the server, which converts it into text and returns the text back to the react frontend.
